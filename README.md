#### a browser for the N8 Equipment Ontology (N8EO) ####


intro
--------------------

The N8 Equipment Ontology (N8EO) and its browser were developed at the University of Manchester by myself, Robert Stevens and Uli Sattler. 

N8EO describes pieces of equipment (shared by institutions affiliated to the N8 Consortium), their underlying technologies, materials, locations, functions and roles. 

This project includes the code for the Web-based ontology browser, built using the [OWL API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/), as well as the ontology file.
