#### a browser for the N8 Equipment Ontology (N8EO) ####


The N8 Equipment Ontology (N8EO) and its browser were developed at the University of Manchester by myself, Robert Stevens and Uli Sattler. The OWL ontology describes pieces of equipment (shared by institutions affiliated to the N8 Consortium), their underlying technologies, materials, locations, functions and roles. 

This project includes the Web-based ontology browser, as well as the ontology file.
